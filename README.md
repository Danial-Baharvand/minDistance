**EFFICIENCY COMPARISON BETWEEN TWO MIN DISTANCE ALGORITHMS**

The 2 algorithms calculate the minimum distance between two elements of a list or array.
The distance between two elements is
taken to be the absolute difference between them. Therefore, the minimum distance is
derived from the two numbers which are closest in magnitude to each other within a series
of numbers. Both algorithms have the same functionality and purpose. The algorithms differ in their methodology
and their efficiencies which are compared to determine the most efficient algorithm of the two.

The algorithms take a single, one-dimensional, unsorted, numerical array, 𝑨, of length n and
return the minimum distance as a single, numerical value denoted 𝒅𝒎𝒊𝒏. For the case
where there are duplicate values within the array, the algorithm returns zero, and for the
case that 𝑨 is empty, infinity is returned.
